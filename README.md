# Steam-VxKex-Guide
**For the Windows 7 Community who strives to use steam on their OS!
Let's get straight to work!**

`Step 1:` Setup Windows 7, install it's updates and drivers. (If Windows 7 Updater doesn't work, try Legacy Patcher or installing the updates by any other means)
Try using Rufus if you are using Windows in order to format the USB with Fat32 and make a bootable USB. Remember, MBR for BIOS & GPT for UEFI.

`Step 2:` Download VxKex

Very cool guy, go give him a follow!
P.S. Make sure you have the KB2533623 & KB2670838 updates installed; many programs depend on it.

`Step 3:` Download Steam, but not the Win 7 version, and neither the latest version. The latest one won't work at the moment, but it may change in the future.
You will need to download "steam_client_win32_1751405894_2025-07-01".

`Step 4:` "steam.exe" has been renamed to "steam_vxkex.exe"; apply VxKex to both "steam_vxkex.exe" and "steamwebhelper.exe (bin/cef/cef.win7x64/steamwebhelper.exe)"
Open the Properties dialog, and select the VxKex tab for each executable.

**Compatibility mode** - Enable VxKex for this program, report a different version of Windows (Windows 10)
**Advanced options** - Disable VxKex for child processes

`Step 5:` Run "steam_vxkex", and let Steam do its work.

`Step 6:` In order to play Video Games, you have to enable VxKex for them too (This is something that I haven't seen anyone mention); otherwise the game will simply crash, or if you have any device with Steam installed on it around the computer, with a video game installed that you wanna play on your Windows 7 PC, it will ask of you to stream it to your PC.

This is not what you want! What you want is to install the Game on your Windows 7 Machine using Steam, and then Enable VxKex for the game too.
Same method as we used for `Step 4`.

`Step 7:` Enjoy my bros!
